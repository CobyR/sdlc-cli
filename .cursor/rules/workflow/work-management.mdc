# Work Management Workflow (SDLC CLI)

When working on the `sdlc-cli` project, use the SDLC CLI's own work management commands to track and manage work items. This project provides comprehensive work item management through the `work` command group.

## Mandatory Workflow for Issue Management

**When starting work on an issue:**
1. Assign the issue to yourself (CobyR): `sdlc w:update --id <number> --assignee CobyR`
2. Add "In Progress" label: `sdlc w:update --id <number> --label "In Progress"`
3. Or combine both: `sdlc w:update --id <number> --assignee CobyR --label "In Progress"`

**When completing work on an issue:**
1. Add "Fixed" label: `sdlc w:update --id <number> --label "Fixed"`
2. Remove "In Progress" label: `sdlc w:update --id <number> --remove-label "In Progress"`
3. Update body with implementation notes (optional but recommended)
4. Or combine: `sdlc w:update --id <number> --label "Fixed" --remove-label "In Progress" --body "Implementation notes..."`

**Important:** Issues should remain OPEN after completion until the version containing the fix is released. They will be closed during the release process.

## Primary Work Management Commands

### Listing Work Items

**Always use `sdlc w:list` (or `sdlc work list`) to view work items:**

```bash
# List all open issues
sdlc w:list

# List issues assigned to you
sdlc w:list --assignee your-username

# List issues with specific labels
sdlc w:list --label "bug" --label "priority:high"

# List closed issues
sdlc w:list --state closed

# Use table format for quick overview
sdlc w:list --format table
```

**When to use:**
- Before starting new work - check what's already in progress
- When looking for work to pick up
- To see the status of related issues
- To review what's been completed

### Getting Work Item Details

**Use `sdlc w:get` (or `sdlc work get`) to view detailed information:**

```bash
# Get full details of a specific issue
sdlc w:get --id 42
```

**When to use:**
- Before starting work on an issue - read the full description
- To understand requirements and acceptance criteria
- To see related issues or parent epics
- To check implementation notes on completed work

### Creating Work Items

**Use `sdlc w:create` (or `sdlc work create`) to create new issues:**

```bash
# Create a simple issue
sdlc w:create --title "Feature description"

# Create with full details
sdlc w:create --title "Feature" --body "Description" --label "enhancement" --assignee username
```

**When to use:**
- When starting work that doesn't have an associated issue
- When breaking down larger work into smaller tasks
- When documenting bugs or improvements discovered during development

### Updating Work Items

**Use `sdlc w:update` (or `sdlc work update`) to update issues:**

```bash
# Assign issue and mark as in progress
sdlc w:update --id 42 --assignee CobyR --label "In Progress"

# Update issue with implementation notes when complete
sdlc w:update --id 42 --body "Updated description with implementation details"

# Mark as fixed (but keep open until release)
sdlc w:update --id 42 --label "Fixed" --remove-label "In Progress"

# Close issue after release
sdlc w:update --id 42 --state closed
```

**Workflow for completing work:**
1. When starting work: 
   - Assign issue to yourself (CobyR)
   - Add "In Progress" label
2. When implementation is complete: 
   - Add "Fixed" label
   - Remove "In Progress" label
   - Update body with implementation notes
   - **Keep issue OPEN** until the version is released
3. After release: Close the issue (or use `sdlc release-helper cleanup`)

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Starting Work

1. **Check current work:**
   ```bash
   sdlc w:list --assignee your-username --state open
   ```

2. **Review the issue:**
   ```bash
   sdlc w:get --id <issue-number>
   ```

3. **Assign issue and mark as in progress:**
   ```bash
   sdlc w:update --id <issue-number> --assignee CobyR --label "In Progress"
   ```

### During Development

- Reference the issue number in commit messages: `[#42] Description`
- Update the issue body with progress notes if needed
- Link related PRs or commits in issue comments

### After Implementation

1. **Update issue with implementation notes:**
   ```bash
   sdlc w:update --id <issue-number> \
     --body "Updated with implementation details..." \
     --label "Fixed" \
     --remove-label "In Progress"
   ```

2. **Verify the update:**
   ```bash
   sdlc w:get --id <issue-number>
   ```

### During Release

- Use `sdlc release-helper cleanup` to automatically close fixed issues
- Or manually close issues after confirming they're in the release:
  ```bash
  sdlc w:update --id <issue-number> --state closed
  ```

## Label Management

**Use `sdlc w:label` commands to manage labels:**

```bash
# List all labels
sdlc w:label list

# Get label details
sdlc w:label get "bug"

# Create new label
sdlc w:label create --name "priority:high" --color "b60205"

# Update label
sdlc w:label update "bug" --color "d73a4a"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check existing issues before creating new ones:**
   - Use `sdlc w:list` to search for similar work
   - Avoid duplicate issues

2. **Use labels consistently:**
   - `In Progress` - Work is actively being done (add when starting, remove when complete)
   - `Fixed` - Implementation complete, waiting for release (add when work is done)
   - `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation` - Issue type
   - `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low` - Priority

3. **Keep issues open until release:**
   - Mark as "fixed" when implementation is done
   - Close only after the version containing the fix is released
   - Use `sdlc release-helper cleanup` for batch closing

4. **Include implementation notes:**
   - Update issue body with what was implemented
   - List files modified
   - Note any breaking changes or migration steps
   - Reference related issues or PRs

5. **Use aliases for speed:**
   - `sdlc w:list` instead of `sdlc work list`
   - `sdlc w:get` instead of `sdlc work get`
   - `sdlc w:create` instead of `sdlc work create`
   - `sdlc w:update` instead of `sdlc work update`

## Integration with Review and Commit Workflow

When using the review-and-commit workflow:

1. **Step 4 (Compare with Open Issues)** should use:
   ```bash
   sdlc w:list --state open
   ```
   Instead of or in addition to `gh issue list`

2. **Step 5 (Handle Issue Association)** should:
   - Use `sdlc w:get --id <number>` to verify issue details
   - When starting work on an issue: Use `sdlc w:update --id <number> --assignee CobyR --label "In Progress"`
   - When completing work: Use `sdlc w:update --id <number> --label "Fixed" --remove-label "In Progress"`

3. **Creating new issues** should use:
   ```bash
   sdlc w:create --title "..." --body "..." --label "appropriate-label"
   ```

## Configuration

Ensure your `.sdlc.json` is configured:

```json
{
  "tracker": "github",
  "repo": "CobyR/sdlc-cli",
  "view": "table"
}
```

This allows you to use work commands without specifying `--tracker` and `--repo` flags every time.
